    <p>HELO HI hi hihi hihihihi hiiiiiii etc. :)
        HAPPY BIRTHDAY :D !! It's kind of crazy that we've known each other for like 5? years now :0
        Will never forget one of our first interactions, the french fry offer :)
        Lots of questionable but cherished moments at Chipotle together too :D
        I'm glad that we've kept talking all this time, I feel like our conversations and everything keep me sane :) Good amount of ranting from both of us but it always a good time :3
        I wish for your birthday I could give you the gift of confidence bc you're always underplaying how smart you are bc you compare yourself to others >:( Stop that nonsense
        Also your crocheting hobby is honestly so cool, it's always so interesting to hear the next thing you're trying to make
        Super duper loved the cat you crocheted for me and everyone I showed thought it was really cute hehe
        ANYWAY I hope you have a super great birthday filled with delicious things like sushi and costco churros and everything you love :)
        Always here for you, and talk to you soon :) Like in a few hours or something probably :) ... Happy 19th!! :></p>

    <p>Hey Julia! I remember the first time we met, you were introduced to me as “Joanne’s roommate” at the badminton courts.
        Initially, I was slightly confused of whether I should approach you and introduce myself, since I didn’t know your name and you seemed so shy.
        The next time we met was the really the first encounter we had.
        After meeting at Joanne’s room, you decided to join us for dinner and the rest is history.
        Now that I look back at it, I am so glad that I was able to get to know you better.
        This small, yet genuine friend group we formed at UCLA is unforgettable and so are the memories and odd conversations that we had
        throughout these past quarters. From watching us suffer from the wraths of the spicy noodles to casually (almost) losing your phone on the hike,
        these memories we had at UCLA will be cherished forever. Thanks for the moments and happy birthday, Julia!</p>
